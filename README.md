## Purpose

This sixth project of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND) instructed me to build a book search and shelf management app using React. Key principles included:
1. Proper management of state, including real-time updates
2. Error handling for failed or invalid searches
3. Consistent interaction with an API data source
4. Proper use of routing using React Router


## How_to_Run

To run the program locally on your computer (requires Internet connection, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, local server, npm)
* Download the repository from GitHub
* In Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) or similar, cd: to directory where repository was downloaded
* run `npm install` and `npm start` to create local server


## Learning

* State Management: I spent the most time here. It was challenging to conceptualize where states and props exist and how they are changed. Maintaining a unidirectional flow of information was a major change in my code-thinking. 
* Routing and Error Handling: These were the most fun, as I saved them for the end of the project, and was impressed by what I had learned by that point. Thinking about the user experience and making sure my program was robust and easy to use was a great experience.
* My Error Recovery: I consulted many resources for this project, from course videos to official React documentation to student webinars. As such, at one point, I had a mostly-functional app that I did not fully understand. And then it broke. I was getting duplicate entries when changing shelves on the search page (but not on the main page). The process of unraveling my code, finding unneccessary complexity, learning/re-learning states and props and components and methods--this was a great capstone to my learning this project.
